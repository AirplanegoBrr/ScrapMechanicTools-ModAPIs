### Custom APIs

This page provides documentation for various custom Lua API modifications for Scrap Mechanic. <br></br>
For example, workshop mods that provide a custom API for other mods, or mods that change the Lua API in other ways.

If you made something that modifies the Scrap Mechanic Lua API and want its features to be documented <br></br>
here, you can do so in multiple ways:

- Add it yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/MrCrackx04/ScrapMechanicTools-ModAPIs)
- Contact me and I'll add it manually:
	- [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/2eACct5FDm)
	- [Discord DM/Ping](https://discordapp.com/users/518349368500420618)
